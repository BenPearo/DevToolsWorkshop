# VSCode Tools

## About VSCode
Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by all platforms. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Along with a huge variety of plugins to help you accomplish just about anything.

## Useful Shortcuts
**Ctrl + [ or ]** : Moves current line one tab left or right, you can select whole blocks of code

**Alt + up or down** : moves current line up or down

**Ctrl + x (no selection)** : cuts entire line

**Alt + left or right** : best shortcut ever, go back or forward through pages, like if you Ctrl + click to get to a definition you can go back easily

**Ctrl + d** : multi-select next occurrence of a selected word (according to find setting), good for changing variable names

**Alt + click** : insert extra cursor at location

**Ctrl + Alt + up or down** : insert extra cursor up or down

**Ctrl + p** : Open file search bar (the search is very smart and search doesn't have to be a substring of the file name)

**Ctrl + Shift + p** : Search all files, commands, and settings (perfect if you forget a shortcut)
